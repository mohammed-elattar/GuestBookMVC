# Guest Book
Each user has an account and needs to login in order to write a new entry for the guestbook.
Guestbook entry can be either a single image or a text. Before a guestbook entry is posted on the
guestbook wall it needs to be validated by an administrator. So there are two different types of users
(guests, admin). Guestbook entries also need to be removable by an administrator.
